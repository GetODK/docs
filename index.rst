Welcome to Open Data Kit's documentation!
=========================================

:dfn:`Open Data Kit` (ODK) is a suite of open source applications that help organizations engaged in enumerator-mediated data collection. ODK tools assist with the collection and management of survey data using mobile forms. These include the primary ODK applications:

- **ODK Collect**, an Android mobile app that replaces paper-based forms.
- **ODK Aggregate**, a server-side data storage and analysis tool.

Also part of the ODK suite are several tools that support form creation and data management:

- **ODK Build** lets you design forms with a drag-and-drop form interface.
- **ODK XLSForm** lets you design forms in Excel.
- **ODK Validate** validates forms against the ODK XForms specification.
- **ODK Form Uploader** uploads blank forms and their media files to ODK Aggregate.
- **ODK Briefcase** packages and transfers data between instances of Collect and Aggregate.

ODK also maintains libraries and specifications that support these applications.

- **ODK XForm** is a subset of the W3 XForm specification, for use in the ODK ecosystem.
- **ODK JavaRosa** is a Java library that renders forms complying with the ODK XForm specification.
