What is ODK?
--------------

Open Data Kit (ODK) is a suite of open source applications that help organizations collect and manage survey data using mobile forms. These include the primary ODK applications:

- **ODK Collect**, an Android mobile app that replaces paper-based forms.
- **ODK Aggregate**, a server-side data storage and analysis tool.

Also part of the ODK suite are several tools that support form creation and data management:

- **ODK Build** lets you design forms with a drag-and-drop form interface.
- **ODK XLS2XForm** lets you design forms in Excel.
- **ODK Validate** validates forms against the ODK XForms specification.
- **ODK Form Uploader** uploads blank forms and their media files to ODK Aggregate.
- **ODK Briefcase** packages and transfers data between instances of Collect and Aggregate.

ODK also maintains several specifications and tools that support these applications. For a complete list of our projects, check out `Open Data Kit on Github <https://github.com/opendatakit>`_.
