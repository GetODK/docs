Form Management in Collect

Loading Blank Forms
====================

A :dfn:`blank form` is a `.xml` file contaning a form definition consistent with the `XForm specification <https://opendatakit.github.io/xforms-spec/>`_. Blank forms can be created using `ODK Build <https://build.opendatakit.org/>`_ or `XLSForm <https://opendatakit.org/use/xlsform/>`_.

In order to complete out forms with survey participants, you must first load blank forms into the Collect App.

.. _in-app-get-blank-forms:

Loading Forms from ODK Aggregate Server or Google Drive 
------------------------------------------------------------

If you have :ref:`connected ODK Collect to a server <connecting-to-server>` or :ref:`Google Drive <connecting-to-google>`, use :guilabel:`Get blank forms` on the app home screen to browse available forms and download them to your device.

.. note::

  Before downloading blank forms from Aggregate or Google Driveto Collect, those forms have to be uploaded. 

  .. link to Aggregate guide, once there is one

.. _loading-forms-directly:

Loading forms directly
------------------------

You can load forms directly from a computer to your device via USB, using `Android Developer Bridge <https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html>`_.

.. code-block:: none

  $ adb push path/to/form.xml /sdcard/odk/forms/form.xml

You can also download forms to  your device via a web browser, and move them to the :file:`odk/forms/` directory, using the device's file manager (:menuselection:`Settings -> Storage & USB -> Explore`).

Loading form media
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a form :ref:`includes images or other media <image-options>`, those files have to be loaded to the device along with the form.

Media files should be placed in a folder labeled :file:`{form-name}-media`. 

- When using ODK Aggregate, the form upload prompt includes instructions to upload the :file:`-media` folder. The files are downloaded automatically when :ref:`fetching forms from Aggregate <in-app-get-blank-forms>`.
- When using Google Drive, the :file:`-media` folder should be uploaded to the same location as the form.
- If :ref:`loading forms directly to your device <loading-forms-directly>`, the :file:`-media` folder needs to be placed in the :file:`sdcard/odk/forms` directory, alongside the form itself.

.. _fill-blank-forms:

Filling out forms
===================

Once you have at least one form :ref:`loaded into ODK Collect <loading-forms-into-collect>`, you can fill out a form. 

- Select :guilabel:`Fill Blank Form` from the app home screen.
- Select the form you would like to fill out from the form list.
- Typically, you will :gesture:`Swipe Left` to advance forward through the question, and :gesture:`Swipe Right` to backup.
  - You can switch from :gesture:`Swipe` navigation to Forward/Backward buttons in :menuselection:`â‹® -> General Settings -> User Interface`
  - Some questions will :ref:`auto-advance <autoadvance-widget>` after being answered.
  - `Required questions <http://xlsform.org/#required>`_ will not allow you to advance unless answered.
- To **remove a response**, :gesture:`Long Press` on the :term:`question label`. 


For a (mostly) complete guide to form question appearance, see :doc:`form-widgets`.

.. _completing-form:

Completing a Form
-------------------

Once you have reached the end of a form, you will have the opportunity to Save and Exit the form. At this point, you may also:

.. _name-form-instance:

Name the form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last form screen provides a default name for the form (defined by the form designer). You can rename it. This name only applies to that particular instance of a completed form (not to the blank form).

The Form Name identifies the form in lists throughout the app. For this reason, a meaningful name may be important to you. 

.. _finalize-form:

Mark the form as *Finalized*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only :formstate:`Finalized` forms can be :ref:`uploaded to a server <uploading-forms>`. 

.. _editing-saved-forms:

Editing *Saved* forms
----------------------

- From the app home screen, select :guilabel:`Edit Saved Form`. 
- From the form list, select a form by name.

This will reopen the form, which are then free to edit.

.. note:: 

  - :formstate:`Sent` forms will not appear in the :guilabel:`Edit Saved Forms` list.

  - You may freely edit :formstate:`Saved` and :formstate:`Finalized` forms.

.. _uploading-forms:

Uploading Finalized Forms
===========================

If you are connected to :ref:`an ODK Aggregate server <connecting-to-aggregate>` or :ref:`Google Drive Account <connecting-to-google>`, use :guilabel:`Send Finalized Forms` to upload :formstate:`finalized` form instances. 

For local form management, use `ODK Briefcase <https://opendatakit.org/use/briefcase/>`_ to pull :formstate:`finalized` form instances to your local computer.

:formstate:`Sent` forms are no longer editable, but they remain viewable until deleted. 

.. note:: 

  You can copy form instances from the device using :command:`adb`, however this will not update the state of the form to :formstate:`Sent`.

.. _deleting-forms:

Deleting Forms
===============

You can delete :formstate:`Saved`, :formstate:`Finalized`, :formstate:`Sent`, and :formstate:`Blank` forms by selecting :guilabel:`Delete Saved Form` on the app home screen.

You can also delete form instances directly with :command:`adb`. They are stored in :file:`sdcard/odk/instances`, with a directory for each instances.
