ODK Forms
=========

Forms provide a structured way to collect and provide information. Typically forms are used by data collectors (also called enumerators) with the :doc:`Collect app <collect-intro>` who ask questions of and share information with participants. For self-report, :ref:`web forms <central-submissions-public-link>` can instead be used.

ODK forms can be used to do things like:

- Conduct a socioeconomic survey of households
- Collect geo-tagged plant species data at different points in time
- Record video and audio of wild animals for later identification
- Guide health workers through a medical triage protocol in multiple languages
- Deliver video-based agricultural training based on a farmer's responses to questions

Forms are made of fields of :doc:`different types <form-question-types>` which can each collect or display one piece of information. Visible fields generally represent questions and are displayed differently based on their type.

Questions can be :ref:`grouped together <groups>` including :ref:`on one screen <field-list>`. They can also be :ref:`repeated <repeats>`. :doc:`Form logic <form-logic>`, :doc:`datasets <form-datasets>`, :ref:`hidden fields <hidden-questions>`, and :doc:`external apps <collect-external-apps>` make it possible to create easy-to-use, but powerful forms that represent :doc:`complex data collector workflows <data-collector-workflows>`.

Most ODK users design their forms in XLSForm with Google Sheets or Excel and examples in this documentation use XLSForm. Get started with the :doc:`XLSForm tutorial <tutorial-first-form>` or the :doc:`XLSForm reference <xlsform>`.
