Android security recommendations
================================

It is important that you secure devices running ODK Collect. We strongly recommend:

- Using the latest version of Android
- Setting a strong passcode or biometrics to secure access to the device
- Using a server with a https:// address, not http://
- Keeping automatic updates turned on
- Making sure that encryption is turned on (default on Android 10+, on older devices this will be configurable in ``Settings`` -> ``Security``)
