:guilabel:`Import/Export Settings` lets you copy settings quickly from one device to another, using a QR code. The QR image presented contains all of your current General and Admin settings, including admin and server passwords. When scanned by the ODK Collect app with another device, these settings are imported.

You can also import settings from a QR code saved to the device, by selecting :guilabel:`Select Code from SD Card`
