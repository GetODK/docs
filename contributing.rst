Authoring Tools and Environment
=====================================

ODK Documentation follows (as much as possible) the `Docs like Code <http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/>`_ philosophy. This means:

- Documention source files are written in a plaintext format. (We use `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.)
- Documentation source files are kept under version control. (We use git and `Github <https://github.com/opendatakit/docs>`_.)
- Documentation is built from source to published output using a static site generator. (We use `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_.)
- Documentation builds are run, tested, and deployed automatically using continuous integration tools. (We use `CircleCI <https://circleci.com/>`_.)

`The Docs as Code approach has many advantages <http://hackwrite.com/posts/docs-as-code/>`_, but we are aware that this approach can feel difficult for writers who aren't used to dealing with the command line. It can also be difficult for coders who are used to this approach, but who typically use simpler authoring tools (like `Jekyll <http://jekyllrb.com>`_ and `Markdown <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>`_).

This section of the Contributor Guide walks through our authoring and publishing workflow and toolchain, to make it as easy possible for you to contribute.
