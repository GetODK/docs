This repo is the source for ODK documentation.

The published documentation is at:

 - https://docs.opendatakit.org
 - https://docs.opendatakit.org/odk2/

If you can't find what you are looking for, try the [old docs on the ODK website](https://opendatakit.org/). Also, please [file an issue](https://github.com/opendatakit/docs/issues) so that we know to add the information you are looking for.

## Building and viewing documentation locally

The following steps help you build and view ODK docs locally. For details on each of these steps, see the [Contributor Guide](http://docs.opendatakit.org/contributing).

### Prerequisites

 * Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
 * Install [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
 
We highly recommend you use a virtual environment like [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or a Python version management like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). (Type `python --version` to see your current version.)

### Cloning the repo

After that, you need to clone the docs repo and make sure all the requirements are installed:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/opendatakit/docs.git
$ cd docs/
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It can take a long time (>10 minutes) to clone the repo due to the large number of images in the docs. If you get an error such as `Smudge error` or `github's rate limit reached`, run `git checkout -f HEAD` until you get the message `Checking out files: 100% done`.

### Building the docs

Once your environment is set up, build and serve the docs locally with:

```bash
$ make odk1
$ cd odk1-build
$ python -m http.server 8000
```

You can then view the docs in your browser at http://localhost:8000.

(Use `odk2` instead of `odk1` to build and serve the ODK2 docs.)

You can also use `make` to build both ODK and ODK2 docs, or to run just a portion of the build process.

For both ODK 1 and ODK 2:

|          |    Build     |     Clean     |     Check Style & Spell     |
| -------- | :---------: | :-----------: | :-----------------: |
| **Options** | build-all |  clean |  check-all |

For a specific ODK version:

|          |    Copy     |     LaTeX     |     Style Check     |    Spell Check     |    Check All   |
| -------- | :---------: | :-----------: | :-----------------: | :----------------: | :----------------: |
| **Options** | odk1-copy |  odk1-latex |  odk1-style-check | odk1-spell-check |    odk1-check     |

To build ODK 2 docs, just replace `odk1` with `odk2`.

## Troubleshooting
- If you get an `extension error` or a `configuration error`:
  - Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
  - Type `python --version` to check your current python version (it should be 3.x).
  - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
