This repo is the source for ODK documentation.

## Current Status â€” Live! (But still new)

Our documentation website is live at https://docs.opendatakit.org

If you can't find what you are looking for, try the [old docs on the ODK website](https://opendatakit.org/). Also, please [file an issue](https://github.com/opendatakit/docs/issues) so that we know to add the information you are looking for.

## Building and viewing documentation locally

> See the [Contributor Guide](http://docs.opendatakit.org/contributing) for detailed steps --- no prior experience needed!

Firstly, make sure you have installed [python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/), we recommend you to use a virtual environment like [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or a Python version management like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). You can take a look at your python and pip version using a  `--version` parameter.

After that, you need to clone this repo and make sure all the requirements are installed:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/opendatakit/docs.git
$ cd docs/
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once your environment is set up, build and run the doc site with:
```bash
$ make odk1
$ cd odk1-build
$ python -m http.server 8000
```

To perform all spell check and style checks before building, use `make odk1-check` instead or `make odk1`.

To build ODK 2 docs, replace `odk1` with `odk2`. 

Here are the all the `make` options you can use:

- ` help`
- `odk1` **|** `odk2` **|** `build-all`
- `odk1_clean` **|** `odk2_clean` **|** `clean`
- `odk1_clean_files` **|** `odk2_clean_files` 
- `odk1_copy` **|** `odk2_copy`
- `odk1-latex` **|** `odk2-latex`
- `odk1-style-check` **|** `odk2-style-check`
- `odk1-spell-check` **|** `odk2-spell-check`
- `odk1-check` **|** `odk2-check` **|** `check-all`
