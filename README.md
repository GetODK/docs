# Open Data Kit Docs

This repo is the source for ODK documentation.

## Current Status â€” New

This is a new repo, for a new set of docs. We haven't started publishing out of this repo yet, so the [old docs on the ODK website](https://opendatakit.org/) are still the place to learn about ODK.

## What's the plan?

 - Docs are being aggregated, rewritten, edited, and expanded into this repo.
    - The first few things we're doing are a getting started guide and a guide to contributing to the documentation. We'll start publishing when those are done. (Soon.)
 - Docs are being built from source with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).
    - Source files for docs are written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).
    - We will be following, as much as possible, a [docs as code](http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) approach to authoring and publishing.
 - This repo will be used as a single source for documentation for all ODK components.
    - There are good reasons for separating the docs into individual repos for each component. We may do this in the future. [Please see this ODK Forum thread to discuss whether to keep all the docs together or disaggregate them.](https://forum.opendatakit.org/t/docs-structure-discussion-one-or-many-repos/7080)

## How to contribute?

We're not quite ready for everyone to jump in and start sending PRs. (Soon.) In the meantime, you can help by:

 - [Engaging in the forum discussions on documentation.](https://forum.opendatakit.org/c/development/documentation)
 - [Filing GH Issues](https://github.com/opendatakit/docs/issues) for specific documentation artifacts that don't currently exist in any form.
 - [Watch](https://github.com/opendatakit/docs/subscription) and Star this repo, to keep up with what we're doing.
