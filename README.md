# Open Data Kit Docs

The goal is to create searchable, well-organized documentation for understanding the ODK ecosystem, getting started and eventually becoming an ODK expert.

This project is just getting started but you can contribute!

* [File issues](https://github.com/opendatakit/docs/issues) for specific things that need to be documented
* Share your thoughts on how the documentation should be structured on [the forum](https://forum.opendatakit.org/c/development/documentation)
