Using Android Debug Bridge with Collect
===========================================

`Android Debug Bridge`_ is a tool that provides command-line access
to a USB-connected Android device.
It can be used to move files between the device and your computer,
install applications,
and take screenshots and videos.
When connected to a device that has ODK Collect installed,
it can be used to push blank form definitions
and pull completed forms.

.. _install-adb:

Installing and setting up ADB
------------------------------------

.. _install-adb-android-studio:

Android Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest and most well-supported way to install ADB is to 
install `Android Studio`_,
which includes ADB.
After installing, you'll need to
`enable USB Debugging`__.

.. _install-adb-standalone:

Standalone ADB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also `install ADB without Android studio`__.
This is not well supported, though,
and should only be done
if you cannot install Android Studio on your computer.

.. _adb-forms:

Managing forms with ADB
---------------------------

Forms are stored on the device in  :file:`/sdcard/odk/forms/`.

.. _loading-blank-forms-with-adb:

Loading blank forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb push local/path/to/form.xml /sdcard/odk/forms/form.xml

.. note::

  The target path on the phone 
  (the last part of the command)
  must include the file name.

.. _deleting-forms-with-adb:

Deleting forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb shell rm -d /sdcard/odk/forms/form.xml

.. _downloading-forms:

Downloading forms to your computer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To download a completed form or form instance from the computer:

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb pull /sdcard/odk/forms/form.xml

  
.. _adb-dev-tasks:
  
Developer tasks and troubleshooting with ADB
-----------------------------------------------
  
.. _downloading-database-with-adb:

Downloading Collect databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collect stores settings and form state information
in a few SQLite databases, 
which you can pull onto your local computer.

.. code-block:: console
  
  $  adb pull /sdcard/odk/metadata/*.db
  
.. _saving-screenshot-with-adb:

Taking screenshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb exec-out screencap /sdcard/image-name.png

To pull the saved image locally:

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb pull /sdcard/image-name.png

.. note::

  ODK Docs contributors can use the :ref:`screenshot utility script <screenshots>`, which wraps the :command:`adb` commands and assists with saving the images to the correct location and inserting appropriate markup in the documentation source.
  
.. _recording-video-with-adb:

Recording video
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/video-name.mp4

When you hit :guilabel:`Enter`, the video starts recording immediately.

To stop the recording, press :kbd:`CTRL-C`. If you don't interrupt the recording, it will stop after three minutes.

To pull the video locally:

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb pull /sdcard/video-name.png

.. _adb-debug-logs:
  
Capturing logs for debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _logcat:

Capturing in-progress logs with logcat
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you are experiencing crashes or other serious glitches,
and you can reproduce the bug,
use :command:`adb logcat` to capture log events during the crash.

#. Before reproducing the bug, begin piping logs to a file:

   .. code-block:: console

     adb logcat > logfile.txt
  
   This will write all logged errors to your local file :file:`logfile.txt` as they occur.

#. Reproduce the bug or crash event.

#. Type :kbd:`CTRL-C` to stop logging.

You can then upload the :file:`logfile.txt` file to 
a `Collect issue on GitHub <https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/issues>`_
or post in the |forum|.

.. _bugreport:

Pull a bug report
""""""""""""""""""

If more in-depth information is needed, 
you can pull a complete bug report from the device.

.. code-block:: console

  adb bugreport
  
This copies a ZIP file locally containing all system messages,
error logs, and diagnostic output,
along with information about the device's
hardware, firmware, and operating system.
