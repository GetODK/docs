Setting Up ODK Briefcase
===================================

.. admonition:: Before you begin...

  You should be able to run Briefcase with Java 8 or higher, but we recommend using `Java 11 LTS <https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_.

#. Download the ODK Briefcase JAR file from `GitHub <https://github.com/opendatakit/briefcase/releases/latest>`_.

	Some browsers may warn that JAR files might harm your computer. Do not worry, Briefcase when downloaded from our GitHub page is safe.

#. Double-click the downloaded JAR file or, from the command line, run :code:`java -jar {path/to/ODK-Briefcase-vX.Y.Z.jar}`

	macOS will warn that Briefcase is from an unidentified developer. This is normal and expected. Follow `these instructions from Apple <https://support.apple.com/kb/ph25088?locale=en_US>`_ to open the file.

#. Follow the instructions to start using Briefcase
