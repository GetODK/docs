Using the Central REST API
==========================

We provide a fully featured REST API for Central. In fact, everything the Central management website does is over the REST API, so everything it can do you can, too: creating users and forms, managing app users, and so on. We also provide compliant standard APIs for OpenRosa and OData.

For more information on using the Central APIs, please visit our `developer documentation <https://odkcentral.docs.apiary.io/#>`_.
