ODK Validate
==================

:dfn:`ODK Validate` is a tool 
that ensures an XForms XML file 
conforms to the `XForms specification`_.

.. _XForms specification: https://opendatakit.github.io/xforms-spec/

Validate should be used to check hand-edited XForms.
It is not needed when creating forms with 
:doc:`xlsform` or :doc:`build-intro`,
unless you edit those forms manually after creating them.

.. warning::

  This tool validates XML files against the XForms specification.
  It does not check every detail needed 
  to ensure smooth operation in the ODK ecosystem.
  For example, Aggregate requires that forms have a unique form ID,
  which this tool does not check.
