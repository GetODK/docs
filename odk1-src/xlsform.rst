:dfn:`XLSForm` is a tool to simplify the creation of forms. Forms designed with Excel can be converted to *XForms* that can be used with ODK tools. It is available for use as `XLSForm Online <https://opendatakit.org/xiframe/>`_ and `XLSForm Offline <https://github.com/opendatakit/xlsform-offline/releases>`_.


Using the Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- To design your form, you can refer to the `XLSForm form design documentation <http://xlsform.org/>`_.
- Once your XLSForm is ready, you convert it with `XLSForm Online <https://opendatakit.org/xiframe/>`_ or `XLSForm Offline <https://github.com/opendatakit/xlsform-offline/releases>`_.


Other XLSForm converters

- :ref:`pyxform <running-pyxform>` is a Python library. It works offline and can be used on the command line to convert forms.
