.. _xlsform-introduction:

:dfn:`XLSForm` is a tool to simplify the creation of forms. Forms designed with Excel can be converted to *XForms* that can be used with ODK tools. It is available for use as `XLSForm Online <https://opendatakit.org/xiframe/>`_ and `XLSForm Offline <https://github.com/opendatakit/xlsform-offline/releases>`_


Using the Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- To design your form, you can refer to the `XLSForm form design documentation <http://xlsform.org/>`_ and check out the `sample Excel file <https://opendatakit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sample_xlsform.xls>`_.
- Once your XLSForm is ready, you convert it with `XLSForm Online <https://opendatakit.org/xiframe/>`_ and `XLSForm Offline <https://github.com/opendatakit/xlsform-offline/releases>`_.


Other XLSForm converters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :ref:`pyxform <running-pyxform>` is a Python library. It works offline and can be used on the command line to convert forms.
- `Ona <https://ona.io/home/>`_, `Kobo <http://www.kobotoolbox.org/>`_, and `Enketo <https://enketo.org/>`_ also offer XLSForm support.

.. note::
  
  - `Enketo <https://enketo.org/>`_ previews generated from this converter will not include media.
  - Forms do not have to be uploaded to :ref:`Aggregate <aggregate-introduction>` before they are used. They can be manually added to :ref:`Collect <collect-introduction>`. Simply place them in the :file:`/odk/forms` folder on your Android deviceâ€™s SD card.
  - For a simpler, more user friendly form designer, try `Build <https://opendatakit.org/use/build/>`_. We also have `sample forms <https://github.com/opendatakit/sample-forms/>`_ (Examples forms are not available for all the features) and `form design documentation <https://opendatakit.org/help/form-design/>`_. And in particular, `design guidelines <https://opendatakit.org/help/form-design/guidelines/>`_ if you wish to design forms manually.
