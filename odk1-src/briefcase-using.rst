Using ODK Briefcase
======================

.. _pull-forms:

Pulling forms
-------------

To pull blank forms and submissions:

1. Open the :guilabel:`Pull` tab.

2. Select a pull source option from the :guilabel:`Pull from` drop-down, and click on the :guilabel:`Configure` button. Fill in any information needed to use the selected source.

    See more on the various sources below.

3. Select the forms you want to pull and click :guilabel:`Pull`.

    You can see the details of the operation by clicking on the |details-button| button.

4. You can cancel an ongoing pull operation at any point by clicking :guilabel:`Cancel`.

.. _pull-from-central:

Central server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Briefcase will ask for the following information when choosing a Central server as the pull source:

- A :guilabel:`URL`
- A :guilabel:`Project ID` number
- An :guilabel:`Email` address
- A :guilabel:`Password`

.. warning::

  The :guilabel:`Start pull from last submission pulled` setting will have no effect while pulling forms from a Central server.

.. _pull-from-aggregate:

Aggregate server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Briefcase will ask for the following information when setting an Aggregate server as the pull source:

- A :guilabel:`URL`
- A :guilabel:`Username` (optional)
- A :guilabel:`Password` (optional)

.. _pull-from-collect:

Collect directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Briefcase will ask for the directory on your computer where you have placed Collect's :file:`/odk` directory. We recommend following these steps to get a copy of Collect's :file:`/odk` directory into your computer:

1. Ensure all filled-in forms are finalized.

    If you have incomplete forms that you cannot finalize before pulling into Briefcase, delete them. If you need to keep them, make a copy of :file:`/sdcard/odk` before deleting them, and restore it after you are finished.

2. Using your device, create a zip archive of the entire :file:`odk` directory with a file managing app such as `OI File Manager <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openintents.filemanager>`_.
3. Transfer the zip file to your local hard drive via a USB cable. You can also use the Share feature in your file manager to transfer it to a third-party service like Google Drive then download it to your local hard drive.
4. Once the zip file is on your local hard drive, unzip the file.

.. warning::

  When pulling from Collect, Briefcase pulls incomplete, saved, or finalized forms. After you pull forms into Briefcase, it is important that you delete them from Collect. Otherwise, the next time you pull, you will create duplicates.

.. _pull-form-definition:

Form definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Briefcase will ask for the location of the blank form definition in your computer.

.. tip::

  This enables a workflow to upload blank form definitions with many media attachments to Aggregate:

  #. Pull the form using the :guilabel:`Pull from` option.
  #. :ref:`Push the form to your Aggregate server <push-to-aggregate>`.

.. warning::

  Ensure that all attached media is available relative to the form definition file location.

.. _push-forms:

Pushing forms
-------------

To push blank forms and submissions:

1. Open the :guilabel:`Push` tab.

2. Select a push target option from the :guilabel:`Push to` drop-down, and click on the :guilabel:`Configure` button. Fill in any information needed to use the selected source.

    See more on the various targets below.

3. Select the forms you want to push and click :guilabel:`Push`.

    You can see the details of the operation by clicking on the |details-button| button.

4. You can cancel an ongoing push operation at any point by clicking :guilabel:`Cancel`.

.. _push-to-central:

Central server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Briefcase will ask for the following information when using a Central server as the push target:

- A :guilabel:`URL`
- A :guilabel:`Project ID` number
- An :guilabel:`Email` address
- A :guilabel:`Password`

.. warning::

  Pushing forms and submissions to Central currently has the following limitations:

  - Central will reject files that might have already been pushed before, even if they're different the second time.
  - Central will reject submissions belonging to a form version that it doesn't know about.

.. _push-to-aggregate:

Aggregate server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Briefcase will ask for the following information when using an Aggregate server as the push source:

- A :guilabel:`URL`
- A :guilabel:`Username` (optional)
- A :guilabel:`Password` (optional)

.. _pull-push-settings:

Pull and push settings
----------------------

The settings for push and pull can be configured in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab:

- You can set a number of :guilabel:`Maximum simultaneous HTTP connections`. This can be increased to speed-up big pull operations or decreased to prevent saturating server bandwidth.

- You can enable :guilabel:`Start pull from last submission pulled` to save time and bandwidth by not pulling from the first submission.

  - This is only available for Aggregate servers at this moment and only benefits forms with more than 100 submissions.

  - You can clear the pull history and pull every submission by clicking on :guilabel:`Clear pull history`.

- You can enable :guilabel:`Remember passwords (unencrypted)`. This will enable a couple of features:

  - Briefcase will remember the pull sources and push targets you configure when they require user credentials. As a result, you won't need to configure them when launching Briefcase again.

  - Briefcase will let you enable the :guilabel:`Pull before export` option when exporting forms.

- You can enable :guilabel:`Use HTTP proxy` to route your HTTP requests through a proxy host. You will have to provide the proxy's :guilabel:`Host` (IP address or hostname), and the :guilabel:`Port` number.

.. _briefcase-export-to-csv:

Export forms to CSV
-------------------

#. Open the :guilabel:`Export` tab.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`Set Default Configuration` button.

  - Set an :guilabel:`Export directory`.
  - If exporting :doc:`encrypted-forms`, set the corresponding :guilabel:`PEM file location`. See :ref:`the Encrypted forms section <create-key>` for more information.
  - If you wish, select a :guilabel:`Start date` and an :guilabel:`End date` to specify a limited date range to export.
  - Toggle export parameters as needed:

    - :guilabel:`Export media files` enables exporting media files into the chosen export directory
    - :guilabel:`Overwrite existing files` enables overwriting form submission data in the output files. The default behavior is to append data.
    - :guilabel:`Split select multiples` enables splitting select multiple fields. Enabling this setting will create an extra output column per select choice, with a `1` if the choice was selected, or `0` otherwise. This only affects select fields without a choice filter and that are not from an external file (including widgets with search appearance).
    - :guilabel:`Include GeoJSON` enables generating a GeoJSON file with spatial data from all exported submissions.
    - :guilabel:`Remove group names` enables removing non-repeat group names from column names in the CSV.
    - :guilabel:`Pull before export` enables trying to pull the selected forms in case there are new form submissions to be exported.

#. Select the forms to export.

   If you are selecting and exporting more than one form, you may need to set individual export settings. To do this, click the gear icon (:guilabel:`âš™`) next to the form name.

#. Click :guilabel:`Export`.

.. tip::

 To import CSVs into Excel, you cannot download and open in one step; nor can you double-click on the CSV. You must open Excel and choose Import. If you are asked, the file origin or encoding is UTF-8.

Output files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Briefcase will generate a different number of files and directories depending on the form's contents and the export configuration selected by the user. This can include, per form:

  - One main CSV file. For example: `Form Name.csv`
  - If the form includes any repeat group, one CSV file for each one of them. For example: `Form Name-repeat group name.csv`
  - If any submission includes binary attachments, they are copied to a `media` directory, relative to the export directory. For example: `media/1538040007350.jpg`
  - If the user enables the :guilabel:`Include GeoJSON export` configuration option, one GeoJSON file with spatial data. For example: `Form Name.geojson`
  - If the form includes audit metadata:

    - One CSV file with audit data from all submissions. For example: `Form Name - audit.csv`
    - One CSV audit file for each exported submission in the `media` directory, relative to the export directory. For example: `media/audit-uuid56880d5e-ee8a-4832-b69d-6dfdd526e2dc.csv`

.. csv-table:: Summary Table
  :header: Output file, How many?, Conditions, Path, Example

  Main CSV, One, , `./`, `Form Name.csv`
  Repeat CSV, One per repeat group, , `./`, `Form Name-repeat group name.csv`
  Binary attachment, As many as there are in submissions, , `./media`, `media/1538040007350.jpg`
  GeoJSON, One, The user enables `Include GeoJSON export`, `./`, `Form Name.geojson`
  Audit CSV, One, The form includes audit metadata, `./`, `Form Name - audit.csv`
  Individual audit CSV, One per submission, The form includes audit metadata, `./media`, `audit-uuid56880d5e-ee8a-4832-b69d-6dfdd526e2dc.csv`

There's more information available about the CSV file content structure and filename patterns in `the export format documentation`_.

.. _briefcase-log-files:

Briefcase log files
-------------------

Briefcase creates a log file with warnings and errors that might be useful for troubleshooting.

.. _briefcase-default-log-file-location:

Default log file location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If something goes wrong while using Briefcase and you look for help, it's possible that you're asked to provide your log file.

The default location for the log file is the directory where you are when launching Briefcase, and the default filename is "briefcase.log"

Briefcase will create the log file on launch if it doesn't previously exist. Otherwise, it will append lines at the end of a pre-existing log file.

.. _briefcase-custom-log-configuration:

How to use a custom log configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optionally, you can use a custom log configuration file to override the default log settings on Briefcase.

First, you need to create a "logback.xml" file somewhere in your computer to contain your custom log configuration. This is a sample configuration file you can use as a template:

.. code-block:: xml

  <configuration>
    <appender name="ROLLINGFILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
      <file>briefcase.log</file>
      <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
        <fileNamePattern>briefcase.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log</fileNamePattern>
        <maxHistory>30</maxHistory>
        <totalSizeCap>100MB</totalSizeCap>
      </rollingPolicy>
      <encoder>
        <pattern>%d [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
      </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root level="info">
      <appender-ref ref="ROLLINGFILE" />
    </root>
  </configuration>


Check the full syntax of Logback configuration files `here`_.

  .. _here: https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html#syntax

You can set all sorts of new log configurations to adapt Briefcase to your needs:

 - Set a fixed log file location
 - Fine tune the log's verbosity by setting a different log level
 - Silence specific log lines while keeping others
 - Set a custom log format (see the `Encoders`_ chapter)
 - Set custom appenders, to define a file rolling policy (daily, by log file size, for example), for example (see the `Appenders`_ chapter)

  .. _Encoders: https://logback.qos.ch/manual/encoders.html
  .. _Appenders: https://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html

Once you have your configuration file ready, you can use it by adding a `-Dlogging.config` argument when launching Briefcase:

.. code-block:: console

  $ java -Dlogging.config="{path/to/logback.xml}" -jar {path/to/briefcase-jar-file}
