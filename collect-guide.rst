.. _collect-introduction:

:dfn:`ODK Collect` is an open source Android app that replaces paper forms used in survey-based data gathering. 

Here is a typical pattern of use:

- :ref:`Get blank forms <loading-forms-into-collect>` from :ref:`ODK Aggregate Server or Google Drive <in-app-get-blank-forms>`
- :ref:`Fill out surveys <fill-blank-forms>` with participants
- :ref:`Upload completed surveys <uploading-forms>` to Aggregate or Google Drive

You can also:

- :ref:`Upload forms directly to Collect <loading-forms-directly>`
- :ref:`Copy form to and from Collect with ODK Briefcase <pull-from-collect>`

Along the way you might want to:

- :doc:`Customize settings <collect-settings>`
- :ref:`Bulk Configure settings <import-export-settings>`
