Collect Guide
******************************

:dfn:`ODK Collect` is an open source Android app that replaces paper forms used in survey-based data gathering. 

Here is a typical pattern of use:

- :ref:`Get blank forms` from an :ref:`ODK Aggregate Server` or :ref:`Google Drive`
- :ref:`Fill out surveys` with participants
- :ref:`Upload completed surveys` to Aggregate or Google Drive

You can also:

- :ref:`Upload forms directly to Collect`
- :ref:`Copy form to and from Collect with ODK Briefcase` (?)
- :ref:`Configure Collect instances via barcode`
