Usage Analytics in Central
==========================

By default, Central does not send any usage analytics.

We are always trying to improve Central.

To do this, we need your feedback, so that we can understand how you are using Central and how it could be better for you. Without the data we need to understand how ODK is actually used by our global community, we cannot make the best decisions to address your most important issues.

Choosing to share anonymized usage analytics with the Central team is voting for your needs!

You can find the Analytics settings under :menuselection:`--> System`, then :menuselection:`--> Improve Central`.

You can select the middle "not interested" option to prevent the yellow reminder at the top of the screen from appearing. Or, you can see an exact sample of the analytics data we send by clicking on the :guilabel:`What metrics are sent?` link.

You can opt to also include your contact information with the data. This does mean we know which server's data is yours. But this also means that if we see something surprising about your use of Central, we can contact you to learn more about your unique needs.
