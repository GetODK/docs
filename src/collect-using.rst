Using ODK Collect
==================

.. admonition:: This is an in-depth guide to using the Collect App

  To learn about the main features and try out ODK, :doc:`see the Getting Started Guide for a quick walk-through. <getting-started>`

ODK Collect is used by :term:`enumerators <enumerator>` to collect survey data by filling out :doc:`forms <form-design-intro>` with :term:`participants <participant>`.

Collect is used to:

1. :ref:`Get blank forms <loading-forms-into-collect>` from :ref:`a server or Google Drive <in-app-get-blank-forms>`
2. :doc:`Fill out surveys  <collect-filling-forms>` with participants
3. :ref:`Upload completed surveys <uploading-forms>` to a server or Google Drive

You can configure Collect and train your enumerators in different ways to best meet your data collection goals. Use the scenarios below to identify features you might be interested in.

I want to configure a lot of devices the same way
Configure one device the way you want and scan the qr code from others. Make your own QR code.

My enumerators perform different tasks at different times
Group forms in different projects

I'm collecting data that is primarily spatial in nature
Use the filled form map as a landing screen
