Managing Projects
=================

.. versionadded:: v2021.2

Starting with Collect v2021.2, Collect can be setup with multiple Projects. Each Project in Collect has its own set of :doc:`Forms <collect-forms>` and Settings.

Each Project is identified by a name, icon and color. These are then shown in at the top of the :ref:`Main Menu <main-menu>`:

.. tip::

  Some examples of scenarios where having more than one project might be useful:

  - An enumerator working working on different data collection efforts across different servers
  - Multiple enumerators using one device for the same data collection project but with different user accounts on the server
  - Form Designers testing forms on different staging/development servers
