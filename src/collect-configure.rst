Configuring ODK Collect
========================

ODK Collect is intended to be a flexible tool that can support many different types of data collection workflows. For many organizations, the only configuration needed will be :doc:`connecting to a server <collect-connect>`. However, there are many cases where additional configuration is helpful. :doc:`collect-settings` describes all of the settings available in the application.

To configure multiple devices, we recommend generating a QR code with settings from one device or an external application as described in :doc:`collect-import-export` and then scanning that code from the devices that need to be configured. Starting in ODK Collect v1.26.0, there is quick access to scan a settings QR code from the main screen:
