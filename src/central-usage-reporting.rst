Usage Reporting in Central
==========================

.. tip::
  By default, Central does not send any usage information to the Central team. Choosing to share anonymized usage analytics with the Central team is voting for your needs!

We are always trying to improve Central.

To do this, we need your feedback, so that we can understand how you are using Central and how it could be better for you. Without the usage information we need to understand how ODK is actually used by our global community, we cannot make the best decisions to address your most important issues.

You can find the Analytics settings under :menuselection:`--> System`, then :menuselection:`--> Improve Central`.

You can select the middle "not interested" option to prevent the yellow reminder at the top of the screen from appearing. Or, you can see an exact sample of the usage information we send by clicking on the :guilabel:`What metrics are sent?` link.

You can opt to also include your contact information with the report. This does mean we know which server's usage report is yours. But this also means that if we see something surprising about your use of Central, we can contact you to learn more about your unique needs.
