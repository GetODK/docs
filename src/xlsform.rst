XLSForm
=======

.. _xlsform-introduction:

:dfn:`XLSForm` is a form standard created to help simplify the authoring of forms in Excel. XLSForms are simple to get started with but allow for the authoring of complex forms.

To design your form, refer to the `XLSForm form design documentation <http://xlsform.org/>`_. Once the form has been designed, :ref:`upload the form to Central <central-forms-upload>`.

.. tip::

  If your ODK server does not support have the latest XLSForm features or you need to temporarily preview a form in a browser, try `XLSForm Online <https://getodk.org/xlsform>`_.

  If you need to design XLSForms offline or your form has sensitive data that you'd rather not upload into XLSForm Online, use the `pyxform <https://github.com/XLSForm/pyxform>`_ command line tool.
