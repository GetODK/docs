.. _location-mode:

Change location mode   
------------------------

You can also choose your location mode based on accuracy, speed, and battery use. Android can help improve location accuracy by triangulating your location off nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers. Combined with data available from your ailing GPS signal, turning on Wi-Fi will greatly improve location accuracy under most conditions.

In the Location section, :gesture:`tap` on :guilabel:`Mode`. 

.. image:: /img/collect-best-practices/mode.png
   :alt: Image showing Mode option.
   :class: device-screen-vertical

Then pick:

  - **High accuracy**: This mode uses GPS, Wi-Fi, mobile networks, and other sensors to get the highest-accuracy location. It uses Google's Location service to help estimate your device's location faster and more accurately.
 
  - **Power saving** or **Battery saving**: This mode uses sources that use less battery, like Wi-Fi and mobile networks. It uses Google's Location service to help estimate your device's location faster and more accurately.

  - **GPS only** or **Device only**: This mode uses only GPS. It doesnâ€™t use Google's Location service to provide location information. It can estimate your device's location slower and use more battery.

.. image:: /img/collect-best-practices/accuracy-mode.png

Using Android Debug Bridge with Collect
==========================================

`Android Debug Bridge <https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html>`_ is a command which acts as a bridge between the Android device and the terminal. It can control device over USB from a computer, copy files back and forth, install and uninstall apps, run shell commands etc. For the developers and users of ODK Collect, the most common uses are:

- loading blank forms to SD Card
- fetching completed forms
- deleting forms
- copying the form database
- installing the **.apk** file from the source code

.. _install-adb:

Installing adb
------------------

If you plan to work on ODK Collect or run the app using an emulator, download the `Android Studio <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html>`_. It already comes with the adb tool. To use it, `enable USB Debugging <https://www.howtogeek.com/125769/how-to-install-and-use-abd-the-android-debug-bridge-utility/>`_.

To install :command:`adb` as a standalone tool, please follow the instructions given `here <https://android.gadgethacks.com/how-to/android-basics-install-adb-fastboot-mac-linux-windows-0164225/>`_.

Forms can be manipulated from the command line itself. The following sections describe how :command:`adb` can be used to work with the app.

.. _loading-blank-forms-with-adb:

Loading blank forms
----------------------

The forms are stored in :file:`sdcard/odk/forms/` folder on the device. They can be loaded via a USB device using:

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb push path/to/form.xml /sdcard/odk/forms/form.xml

.. note::

  Path on the phone must include the file name and not just the folder name

.. _deleting-forms-with-adb:

Deleting forms
-----------------

Forms can be deleted from :file:`sdcard/odk/forms` by running:

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb shell rm -d /sdcard/odk/forms/my_form.xml

.. _downloading-forms:

Downloading forms to your computer
------------------------------------

To download a completed form or form instance from the computer, run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb pull /sdcard/odk/forms/my_form.xml

.. _downloading-database-with-adb:

Downloading database
----------------------

Developers might also need to check the entries in the database from the computer. In such case pull the database file from the SD card and use any **SQLite visualizer** to view it. To pull the database into the computer, run:

.. code-block:: console
  
  $  adb -pull /sdcard/odk/database/database.name

.. _saving-screenshot-with-adb:

Saving screenshot
--------------------

For taking a screenshot, run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb exec-out screencap /sdcard/screen.png

Here, the image will be stored as ``screen.png`` which can be downloaded to the computer by running:

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb pull /sdcard/screen.png

.. note::

  You can also use ODK docs program to get a screenshot by referring to the instructions given in the :ref:`Contribution Guide <screenshots>`.

.. _recording-video-with-adb:

Recording a video
--------------------

:command:`adb` can be used to record video on device's screen. This can be done by running:

.. code-block:: console

  $ adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/example.mp4

As you hit :guilabel:`Enter`, this command will start recording your deviceâ€™s screen using the default settings and save the resulting video to a file at :guilabel:`/sdcard/example.mp4` file on your device.

To stop the recording, press :guilabel:`ctrl` + :guilabel:`C`

.. _using-command-line:
  
Using Command Line 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also run the emulator using command line. Follow the steps given below to start your emulator using the command line:

.. note::

  If SDK installation has been put in another drive or folder instead of in its default location of ``$USER_HOME`` or ``$HOME``. Make sure you have set the environment variables according to that. In the command line type the following command to set environment variables.
  
  .. code-block:: console
  
    set ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=path\sdk\


1. Open the terminal and move to the :file:`emulator` folder of the `SDK` directory.

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd emulator
  
2. For the list of available virtual devices, type the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ emulator -list-avds
 
.. tip::

  If you are not able to locate :file:`emulator.exe` file in :file:`SDK` folder. Type the following command to know the location of the file:
  
  .. code-block:: console

    $ which emulator
  
  On Windows:
  
  .. code-block:: doscon

    > where emulator

3. Use :command:`emulator` to start the emulator. Here *avd_name* is the name of Android virtual device that you have created.

.. code-block:: console

  $ emulator -avd avd_name

.. note::
  
  1. You can use :command:`sdkmanager` command to update, install, and uninstall packages for the Android SDK. This method is not recommended as it is not   user-friendly and also takes time.

     To create an emualtor you need to download system image for a particular API level.
	
    .. code-block:: console

      $ sdkmanager --verbose "system-images;android-19;google_apis;x86"
	  
	  
    - The :option:`--verbose` option or :option:`-v` option shows errors, warnings and all messages.
    - ``system-images;android-19;google_apis`` specifies the system image package for the Android virtual device.
    - ``android-19`` specifies the API level. You can choose different API level if you want.
   
  2. To create and manage Android Virtual device from the command line, you can use :command:`avdmanager`.
  
     After downloading system image, you can use the following command to create an emulator.
   
    .. code-block:: console

      $ avdmanager -v create avd --name testAVD -k "system-images;android-19;google_apis;x86" -g "google_apis"
	  
	 
    - The :option:`create avd` option creates a new Android virtual device.
    - :option:`--name` option is a **required** option which is used to specify name of the AVD. Here, the name of the AVD is testAVD.
    - The :option:`-g` specifies the sys-img tag to use for the AVD.
    - :option:`-k` specifies package path of the system image for the AVD.
   
.. _genymotion:

Genymotion
------------

  You can also use `Genymotion <https://www.genymotion.com/>`_ as an alternative as it is very fast as compared to custom android emulators. It is also easy to use and configure, and it is available free of cost for personal use.
