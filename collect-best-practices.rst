.. _location-mode:

Change location mode   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also choose your location mode based on accuracy, speed, and battery use. Android can help improve location accuracy by triangulating your location off nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers. Combined with data available from your ailing GPS signal, turning on Wi-Fi will greatly improve location accuracy under most conditions.

In the Location section, :gesture:`tap` on :guilabel:`Mode`. 

.. image:: /img/collect-best-practices/mode.png
   :alt: Image showing Mode option.
   :class: device-screen-vertical

Then pick:

  - **High accuracy**: This mode uses GPS, Wi-Fi, mobile networks, and other sensors to get the highest-accuracy location. It uses Google's Location service to help estimate your device's location faster and more accurately.
 
  - **Power saving** or **Battery saving**: This mode uses sources that use less battery, like Wi-Fi and mobile networks. It uses Google's Location service to help estimate your device's location faster and more accurately.

  - **GPS only** or **Device only**: This mode uses only GPS. It doesnâ€™t use Google's Location service to provide location information. It can estimate your device's location slower and use more battery.
